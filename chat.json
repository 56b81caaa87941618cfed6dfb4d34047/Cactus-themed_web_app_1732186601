Wallet connection and chain checking functionality\n2. Buttons for each contract method\n3. Display of results for each method call\n4. Error handling for failed calls\n5. Responsive layout using Tailwind CSS\n\nPlease note that this component assumes the user has MetaMask or a similar Web3 wallet installed in their browser. If the user doesn't have a compatible wallet, they will see an error message in the console.\n\nAlso, remember that this component only interacts with view functions, which don't require gas fees or transaction signing. If you need to interact with state-changing functions in the future, additional handling for transactions would be required.\n",
