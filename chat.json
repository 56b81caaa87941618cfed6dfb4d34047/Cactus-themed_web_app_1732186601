Implemented staking, unstaking, and reward claiming functionalities.\n2. Used OpenZeppelin's IERC20, SafeERC20, and Ownable contracts for token interactions and access control.\n3. Implemented a reward distribution mechanism based on the time elapsed and total staked amount.\n4. Added functions to view user stakes and total staked amount.\n5. Included events for important actions like staking, unstaking, and claiming rewards.\n\nCaveats and assumptions:\n1. The contract uses placeholder addresses for staking and reward tokens. You need to replace these with actual token addresses before deployment.\n2. The initial reward rate is set to 100 tokens per second. Adjust this value as needed before deployment.\n3. The contract assumes that the reward token has been transferred to the contract before rewards are distributed.\n\nInstructions for deployment and interaction:\n1. Replace the placeholder token addresses in the constructor with actual token addresses.\n2. Ensure that the contract has sufficient reward tokens before users start staking.\n3. After deployment, users can interact with the contract by calling stake(), unstake(), and claimRewards() functions.\n4. The owner can adjust the reward rate using the setRewardRate() function.\n\nRemember to thoroughly test the contract and consider a professional audit before deploying it on the mainnet.\n",
